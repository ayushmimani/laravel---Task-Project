In this tutorial, we explore how to reuse form markup between a create and an edit form in Laravel using the Blade include directive.

1. **Creating a Common Form View**

    - We create a new Blade file named `form.blade.php` in the `views` directory.
    - The form will be designed to handle both create and edit actions.

2. **Determining Form Type**

    - We check if a `task` variable is passed to the view.
    - If the variable is present, it's an edit form; otherwise, it's a create form.

3. **Setting Action and Method**

    - Depending on whether a task is passed:
        - Use `task.update` route for edits (PUT method).
        - Use `task.store` route for creates (POST method).

4. **Handling Form Fields**

    - Use the old input helper to preserve form data in case of validation errors.
    - For each field (title, description, long description), use the `??` operator to fill the field with old data if available.

5. **Dynamic Button Label**

    - Set the button label dynamically based on whether the task variable is set.

6. **Implementation in Blade Templates**

    - Remove duplicate form code from `create.blade.php` and `edit.blade.php`.
    - Instead, include the `form.blade.php` file and pass the `task` variable when editing.

7. **Validation and Testing**

    - Ensure validation errors are displayed correctly.
    - Test both create and edit functionalities to verify that everything works as expected.

8. **Conclusion**
    - Using the Blade include directive, we created a reusable form view that handles both create and edit scenarios.
    - This approach can be extended beyond forms to reuse any markup with minor modifications.
